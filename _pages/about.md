<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I specialize in computational linguistics and natural language processing (NLP), focusing on enhancing models for Portuguese language understanding. My experience includes fine-tuning machine learning models, annotating and analyzing linguistic data, and developing automated tools to support language analysis. I’m dedicated to using data-driven insights to explore language complexity, improve natural language understanding, and support linguistic research through a combination of quantitative analysis, corpus linguistics, and programming.
